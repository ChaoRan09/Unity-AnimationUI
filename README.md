|`PlayReversed()`                   | Play the animation but reversed. Usefull to go back from a certain menu quickly.|
|`AddFunctionAt(float time, delegate func)`| Add a function to be called at a certain time after the AnimationUI.Play() is called|
|`AddFunctionAtEnd(delegate func)`  |Add a function to be called at a certain time after the animation is finished |

- readme to explain others category for custom button demos, etc.
- There's also reverse button usefull to go back from other menu
- if you're not sure about which variable to animate, you can always capture all variable with the set start or the set end button. One example is when you want to animate Rect Transform with Anchor Presets of strectch. just try enabling all variable and set everything, you might be able to produce some good results
- you may not need to code anything even if you want to create animation that for example has an object with position relative to the left side of the screen, maybe hidden outside screen, then it change into the middle
- show example even if the screen is so long, it will still work
- make sure to press the preview start because you may accidentally do something like disabling all input
- Theres progress indicator individually
- PlayOnStart usefull for transition to a new scene
- Put singleton in resource folder
- There's no proper way to block all input so please modify button block
